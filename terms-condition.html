                                    If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change

                                    You may cancel a Recurring Subscription at any time, but if you cancel your
                                    subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund
                                    any subscription fees already paid to us. You acknowledge that the amount charged at
                                    the beginning of the first month of your subscription may include a promotional

                                    may result from the expiration of the first month discount, changes in subscription
                                    fees, applicable taxes, or other factors affecting the overall cost of services.</p>

                                    maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary and confidential information
                                    disclosed by the other party ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information

                                    financial information, and any other information marked as confidential or that a
                                    reasonable person would understand to be confidential. Each party agrees not to

                                    consent of the disclosing party, except as required by law or court order. Each
                                    party further agrees to use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of
                                    performing its obligations under this Agreement and to take all necessary
                                    precautions to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential
                                    Information. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, each party agrees to
                                    return or destroy all Confidential Information received from the other party and to
                                    provide written certification of such return or destruction upon request.</p>

                                    period of 12 months following its termination, You shall not, directly or
                                    indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee, contractor, or agent of
                                    SPORTS EMPIRE for the purpose of offering them employment, engagement, or services.
                                    During and for one year after the term of this Agreement, You shall not make any
                                    negative or derogatory statements or remarks about SPORTS EMPIRE, its employees,
                                    agents, contractors, or services in any public forum, including but not limited to

                                    written, that could damage SPORTS EMPIRE's reputation or business interests. SPORTS

                                    non-disparagement provisions set forth in this Agreement, SPORTS EMPIRE shall be
                                    entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, monetary penalties,
                                    and/or any other legal remedies available to it. SPORTS EMPIRE also reserves the
                                    right to pursue monetary damages for any disparaging remarks made in a public forum
                                    of any kind, including but not limited to social media platforms, public reviews, or
                                    online forums. These damages may include but are not limited to liquidated damages,
                                    as well as actual damages incurred by SPORTS EMPIRE as a result of the breach.
                                    Nothing in this provision shall prevent You or SPORTS EMPIRE from providing truthful
                                    information in response to legal process or in connection with any legal action or
                                    proceeding. In the event of a blatant violation of the non-disparagement provision
                                    by You, You shall be liable to SPORTS EMPIRE for liquidated damages in an amount
                                    equal to double the total amount paid to SPORTS EMPIRE under this Agreement. For the
                                    avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to compensate SPORTS EMPIRE for the
                                    harm caused by such breaches and shall not be construed as a penalty.</p>

                                <p>These Terms of Service, along with documents incorporated by reference, form the
                                    comprehensive agreement between you and SPORTS EMPIRE that guides your use of our
                                    Services and your account. This agreement supersedes any prior arrangements between
                                    you and SPORTS EMPIRE, including previous versions of the Terms of Service.</p>

                                <p>SPORTS EMPIRE's failure to enforce or exercise any right or provision of these Terms
                                    will not imply a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision within these
                                    Terms, including all conditions and documents it incorporates by reference, is
                                    deemed unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision will be modified
                                    to achieve the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by
                                    law. The remaining provisions will continue in full force.</p>

                                <p>Apart from SPORTS EMPIRE and its affiliates, no person or entity who is not party to
                                    these Terms will have any right to enforce any of its terms, unless expressly stated
                                    within these Terms. The governing law for these Terms will be the laws of Florida
                                    and the laws of the United States applicable therein, regardless of conflict of laws
                                    principles.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>These Terms will apply to and benefit both parties, as well as their respective
                                    heirs, successors, permitted assigns, and legal representatives. SPORTS EMPIRE
                                    reserves the right to assign these Terms without your consent or notification. You
                                    may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to any third
                                    party without SPORTS EMPIRE's prior written consent.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>On termination, all corresponding rights and obligations under these Terms cease
                                    immediately. However, you will remain liable for obligations connected to
                                    transactions entered into before termination, any liabilities accrued prior or as a
                                    result of termination, and certain sections of these Terms will survive termination.
                                </p>

                                <p>These Terms, the Privacy Policy, and other legal documents make up the entire
                                    agreement between you and SPORTS EMPIRE regarding our Services. If any provision
                                    within these documents is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
                                    rest of the provisions remain in full force and effect. SPORTS EMPIRE's failure to
                                    enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be seen as a waiver of such provision
                                    or right.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>SPORTS EMPIRE may assign all contractual rights and obligations under these Terms to
                                    any affiliate, partner, or third party at its sole discretion, without further
                                    consent or notification. Most communications between SPORTS EMPIRE and you will be
                                    electronic, satisfying any legal requirements for written communication.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If any provision, or portion of the provision, in these Terms of Service is, for any
                                    reason, held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then such
                                    invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision (or
                                    the unaffected portion of the provision) of the Terms of Service, and the Terms of
                                    Service will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision, or
                                    portion of the provision, had never been contained within the Terms of Service.</p>

                                <p>Any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as per the applicable Terms, will
                                    be resolved exclusively within the jurisdiction of Miami, Florida. You agree that
                                    any claim arising out of these Terms must be filed within one (1) year of its
                                    occurrence or be forever barred. You may not assign these Terms without SPORTS
                                    EMPIRE's prior written consent. We will not be held responsible for any delay or
                                    failure in performance due to circumstances beyond our control.</p>
